    "In this project I am going to show different types of crimes and collisions which have been occurring  in Seattle for  the last several years and map those crimes and collisions by neighborhoods. The project is also designed to identify the safest place to live in Seattle from different types of crimes. In this project I also tried to see the distribution of crimes and car collisions spatially across different neighborhoods in Seattle. I also tried to show the most important venues across each neighborhood in Seattle using the foursquare api. This report  targeted stakeholders interested in looking for a safe place in Seattle either to open a business or to find a house to live or to buy."
